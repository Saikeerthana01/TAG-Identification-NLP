# TAG-Identification-NLP
Tag Identification in NLP automatically finds important words or phrases (tags) from text. It tokenizes the text, removes common words, counts word frequency, and visualizes top tags. Useful for content organization, summarization, and keyword generation using Python libraries like NLTK and matplotlib.
