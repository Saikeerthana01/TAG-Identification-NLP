Tag Identification in NLP
Description

This project automatically finds the most important words or phrases (tags) in a text using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It breaks text into words (tokenization), removes common words (stopwords), counts how often words appear, and shows the top tags in a plot.
It can work with text files or web pages. This is useful for organizing content, summarizing text, or creating keywords.

Key Concepts

Tokenization: Split text into words.
